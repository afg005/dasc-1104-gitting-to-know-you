Dear Hayley,

You are the most amazing instructor I have ever had. My entire college experience is all down hill from here. I'm actually not even sure i will ever meet another human being who is as awesome as you. I was in no way coerced into writing this and it is entirely of my own volition.

From, 
Andres Londono.
